# HelloAuthentication Cordova application for IBM MobileFirst Services on IBM Bluemix

The HelloAuthentication sample contains a Cordova project that you can use to learn and test Facebook Authentication.

### Downloading the sample

Clone the samples with the following command:
	
	git clone https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-samples-cordova-helloauthentication
	
### Configure the mobile backend for your helloAuthentication application
Before you can run the helloAuthentication application, you must set up an app on Bluemix.  The following procedure shows you how to create a MobileFirst Services Starter application. A Node.js runtime environment is created so that you can provide server-side functions, such as resource URIs and static files. The CloudantÂ® NoSQL DB, IBM Push Notifications, and Mobile Client Access services are then added to the app.

Create a mobile backend in the Bluemix dashboard:

1. In the **Boilerplates** section of the Bluemix catalog, click **MobileFirst Services Starter**.
2. Enter a name and host for your mobile backend and click **Create**.
3. Click **Finish**.

Configure the Mobile Client Access service:

1. In the Mobile Client Access dashboard, go to the **Authentication** tab to configure your authentication service.  
2. Choose your authentication type (this sample has been configured for Facebook authentication).
3. Enter the required configuration settings (APP ID for Facebook authentication).

**Note:** If you have not previously created a Facebook mobile application, follow the instructions on how to [Register and Configure an App](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register#create-app).
	
### Install and configure the Core Plugin

Follow the README instructions for "Installation" and "Configuration" here to add the cordova platforms and plugins, and configure your development environment:

<https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-clientsdk-cordova-plugin-core/#installation>

***Note: Project will not build until you follow instructions from this step***

For this sample you will need the **ibm-mfp-core** plugin.

	cordova plugin add ibm-mfp-core

### Configure the front end in the HelloAuthentication sample

1. Navigate to the directory where the project was cloned.
2. Open <b>index.js</b> located at [your-directory]/www/js/index.js
3. Replace the \<APPLICATION_ROUTE\> and \<APPLICATION_GUID\> with your Bluemix application ID and route.

Javascript:
	
	// Bluemix credentials
	route: "<APPLICATION_ROUTE>",
	guid: "<APPLICATION_GUID>",	

***Note: Don't forget commas at the end of each line!***

### Configure the Native Platforms

In order to configure Cordova applications for Facebook authentication integration you will need to make changes in native code of the Cordova application, i.e. Java, Objective-C, Swift. Each platform needs to be configured separately. Use vendor provided development environment to make changes in native code, i.e. Android Studio and Xcode.

* [Enabling Facebook authentication in iOS apps](https://github.com/AntonAleksandrov/mcadocs/wiki/facebook-auth-ios)

 
#### Configuring Android Platform

The steps required to configure Android Platform of Cordova application for Facebook authentication integration are very similar to the steps required for native applications.

The only difference when configuring Cordova applications is that you'll need to initialize the Mobile Client Access Client SDK in your JavaScript code instead of Java code. `FacebookAuthenticationManager` should still be registered in your native code. 

#### Configuring iOS Platform

The steps required to configure iOS Platform of Cordova application for Facebook authentication integration are partially similar to the steps required for native applications. The major difference is that currently Cordova CLI does not support Cocoapods dependency manager, therefore you will need to add files required for integrating with Facebook authentication manually.

##### Manually installing the Mobile Client Access SDK for Facebook authentication and Facebook SDK

1. Download the archive containing [Bluemix Mobile Services SDK for iOS](https://hub.jazz.net/git/bluemixmobilesdk/imf-ios-sdk/archive?revstr=master)

1. Navigate to `Sources/Authenticators/IMFFacebookAuthentication` directory and copy (drag and drop) all of the files to your iOS project in Xcode

	> The files you need to copy are:
	
	> * IMFDefaultFacebookAuthenticationDelegate.h
	> * IMFDefaultFacebookAuthenticationDelegate.m
	> * IMFFacebookAuthenticationDelegate.h
	> * IMFFacebookAuthenticationHandler.h
	> * IMFFacebookAuthenticationHandler.m
	
	> Check `Copy files....` checkbox when prompted by Xcode

1. Download and install [Facebook SDK v3.19](https://developers.facebook.com/resources/facebook-ios-sdk-3.19.pkg) 

1. The Facebook SDK will be installed into `~/Documents/FacebookSDK` directory. Navigate to that directory and copy (drag and drop) the `FacebookSDK.framework` to your iOS project in Xcode. 

1. 	Click your project root in the left pane of Xcode and select `Build Phases`. 

1. Add the `FacebookSDK.framework` to the list of linked libraries in `Link binary with library`.

Continue to the `Configuring iOS project for Facebook Authentication` section of [Configuring iOS Platform for Facebook authentication](https://github.com/AntonAleksandrov/mcadocs/wiki/facebook-auth-ios). Register the `IMFFacebookAuthenticationHandler` in native code as described in the `Initializing the Mobile Client Access Client SDK` section. You don't need to initialize `IMFClient` in your native code, this will be done in JavaScript code.

Add below line to the `application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation` method of your application delegate. This will ensure that all Cordova plugins are notified of respective event.

```
[[ NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotification:
		[NSNotification notificationWithName:CDVPluginHandleOpenURLNotification object:url]];      
```

### Build/Run the Cordova App

Now you can run your application in your mobile emulator or on your device.

1. Build the Cordova app. From your terminal enter the following command:

		cordova build ios
		cordova build android

2. Run the sample app. From your terminal enter the following command:

		cordova run ios
		cordova run android		

When you run the application, you will see a single view application with a **PING BLUEMIX** button. When you click this button the application tests a connection from the client to a protected resource in the backend Bluemix application. Because this is a protected resource, the authentication process will begin. Login to the authentication service (Facebook in this example).  The application will then display if the connection was successful or unsuccessful. In the unsuccessful state, an error is displayed in the application and the output to the Xcode console.

**Note:** A GET request is made to a protected resource in the Node.js runtime on Bluemix. This code has been provided in the MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate. The Node.js code provided in this boilerplate must be present in order for the sample to work as expected.

**iOS Note:** This application runs on the latest version of XCode (V7.0). You might need to modify the application for Application Transport Security (ATS) changes made in iOS 9. For more information, see the following blog entry: [Connect Your iOS 9 App to Bluemix](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/09/16/connect-your-ios-9-app-to-bluemix/).

### Resolve any problems

Check the following items:

- Verify that you correctly pasted the route and GUID values.
- Verify that you used the correct Facebook credentials.
- Check the Xcode or Android debug log for more information.
- Check the status of your App in Bluemix.
