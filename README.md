# HelloAuthentication Cordova application for IBM MobileFirst Services on IBM Bluemix

The HelloWorld sample contains a Cordova project that you can use to learn.

### Create your mobile backend in Bluemix

1. In the Boilerplates section of the Bluemix catalog, click MobileFirst Services Starter.
2. Enter a name and host for your app and click Create.
3. Click Finish. 

### Downloading the sample

Clone the samples with the following command:
	
	git clone https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-samples-cordova-helloauthentication
	
### Configure the mobile backend for your helloAuthentication application
Before you can run the helloAuthentication application, you must set up an app on Bluemix.  The following procedure shows you how to create a MobileFirst Services Starter application. A Node.js runtime environment is created so that you can provide server-side functions, such as resource URIs and static files. The CloudantÂ® NoSQL DB, IBM Push Notifications, and Mobile Client Access services are then added to the app.

Create a mobile backend in the Bluemix dashboard:

1.	In the **Boilerplates** section of the Bluemix catalog, click **MobileFirst Services Starter**.
2.	Enter a name and host for your mobile backend and click **Create**.
3.	Click **Finish**.

Configure the Mobile Client Access service:

1.	In the Mobile Client Access dashboard, go to the **Authentication** tab to configure your authentication service.  
2.  Choose your authentication type (this sample has been configured for Facebook authentication).
3.  Enter the required configuration settings (APP ID for Facebook authentication).

**Note:** If you have not previously created a Facebook mobile application, follow the instructions on how to [Register and Configure an App](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register#create-app).

### Setting up Facebook authentication
Update the `Info.plist` file with your Facebook App information:

- **FacebookAppID** (For example `1581349575427190`): You can get the App ID from the Facebook developer console.
- **FacebookDisplayName** (For example `helloAuth`): You can get App name from Facebook developer console.

Update URL Types, Item 0, URL Schemes, update Item 0 as follows:

- **URL Schemes**: (for example `fb1581349575427190` , fb+Client ID from Facebook developer console)

### Configure Cordova

Follow the README instructions for "Installation" and "Configuration" here to add the cordova platforms and plugins, and configure your development environment: <https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-clientsdk-cordova-plugin-core/#installation>

***Note: Project will not build until you follow instructions from this step***

For this sample you will need the **ibm-mfp-core** plugin.

	cordova plugin add ibm-mfp-core
  
### Configure the front end in the HelloWorld sample

1. Navigate to the directory where the project was cloned.
2. Open <b>index.js</b> located at [your-directory]/www/js/index.js
3. Replace the \<APPLICATION_ROUTE\> and \<APPLICATION_GUID\> with your Bluemix application ID and route.

Javascript:
	
	// Bluemix credentials
	route: "<APPLICATION_ROUTE>",
	guid: "<APPLICATION_GUID>",	

***Note: Don't forget commas at the end of each line!***

### Build/Run the Cordova App

Now you can run your application in your mobile emulator or on your device.

1. Build the Cordova app. From your terminal enter the following command:

	cordova build ios
	cordova build android

2. Run the sample app. From your terminal enter the following command:

	cordova run ios
	cordova run android		

You will see a single view application with a "PING BLUEMIX" button. When you click this button the application will test the connection from the client to the backend Bluemix application. The application uses the ApplicationRoute specified in **index.js** in order to test the connection. The application will then display if the connection was successful or unsuccessful. In the unsuccessful state an error will be displayed in the Xcode/Android log, as well as in the application.

***Note: A GET request is made to a protected resource on the Node.js runtime on Bluemix. This code has been provided in the MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate. If the backend application was not created using the MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate the application will not be able to connect successfully.***

### Resolve any problems

Check the following items:

- Verify that you correctly pasted the route and GUID values.
- Check the Xcode or Android debug log for more information.
- Check the status of your App in Bluemix.
